          <p>Introducing the feature</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          First of all, we wanted to introduce the feature by prompting the full screen modal to make sure that everyone sees the release. We decided to take users to their list of items that they are selling as an optional CTA so that they can quickly try out the Private offers.

          <p>Sending out the private offers</p>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          We wanted to make something that enables people to reduce their price only to the buyers who were interested in their item so that they can keep their original price.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          The challenging part was to make it intuitive for users since the concept of "private offers" was something wasn't conventional. We also needed to think about the existing "Public sale" feature which would live in the similar category. To co-exist with the "Public sale", we decided to integrate this into the same navigation as they are contextually similar.

          For the items that users liked, they will then recieves a private offer from the seller via inbox. Buyer can directly accept the offer to purchase the item or they can further negotiate by using the messaging.

          The most important and challenging part of this feature was how users navigate and how they set the right price. Especially setting the right price was vital to make transaction successful, so we did some initial exploration to get the right experience.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          For the price setting, we decided to go with the most seamless and uncluttered way which was to show a recommended price until you intentionally edit the offer price.
