        <p>Seller Tiers is a loyalty program where sellers can get a lower sales fee based on their earnings on the marketplace. We wanted to encourage users to list more but also behave like a good citizens(less cancel rates, less returns) and we reward them for it in return.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="left">
          For users to activate their Seller Tiers program, we decided to prompt a dialog at the time of their first listing as the main opt-in. This was the most relevant timing as we can only show it to the users who are intending to sell their items on our marketplace.
        </div>
        <div class="right">
          We've also had couple of more places where user can activate such as post sell and settings as a secondary option.

          After several visual explorations, we decided to stay simple and intuitive for people who see it for the first time. Each level has it's own color to convey your level and Tier benefit section showcases your next tier as well as the entire tiers as you expand.

          I also worked with UX copywriters to come up with unique copies on each screens to make sure that it excites our users to make further progress.

          We have several places such as settings, order status to view your Seller Tier detail, but we decided to make user profile as the main screen as it contextually made most sense and it also had a highest traffic by the sellers.
