          For our users to on board into the flow, there are two different options. Primary way is by tapping into the List an item call to action. We triger this only for those who never listed on Mercari as we intended to help people who aren't familiar with selling in general.

          Secondary option is to opt in by the banner in case people did not tap into the sell an item call to action.

          Selling is a core of Mercari yet not many people have sold online before. We wanted to motivate our users before they begin looking for what they can sell. In order to achieve this, we decided to use a copy <b>"Up to $1,000"</b> which then we help users to discover items that can potentially create $1,000 in the next step.

        <div class="right">
          In the other screens, we also created a content that brings about sense of urgency and some social proof.

          As our primary goal was to help people discover things that they can sell from home, what we did was asking them to pick the items that you can commonly find at home. By selecting each one, it shows accumulated potential earnings to give some gamification experience. We then take users to the selling page with the items that they have selected.

          We've had some different <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dsU3cqM5WyZ05lerL4LMGf/All?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">variant</a> before we actually landed on our final design. In order to get some real life feedback, we've conducted user testing and targeting those who never used our service before.

        <div class="right">
          Through this user testing, we've learned that most of them would complete the whole flow and motivated to sell by reminding them what they can sell and how much they can potentially make. We also learned that some of the users felt that the process was too long and got tired within a half way through.
